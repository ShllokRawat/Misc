#1. Create an example of inherited classes, Employee (superclass)
#Teacher and Staff will be seperate child classes
#i did not understand thsi syntax also#


#2. Finish this tree code which looks for a number in a tree
#and returns true if the number is found

def find_number(tree, number):

#I did not understand the concept  of trees propperly can you help#

#3. Try this recursive problem. Use recursion to check if
#an integer is comprised of increasing numbers

def increasing_sequence(number, n ):
	n =[]
	for len in number:
		n.append(numbers)
		if(n1 > n2):
			return increase_sequence(n2)
			X = 1
				if(X == len(n)):
					print("This integer consists of increasing numbers")
		else:
			print("This integer does not consist of increaing numbers")
